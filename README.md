# Battleship
A fully playable version of Battleship that I made as a passion project while learning Java at University.
Well... it's Battleship, hardly an exciting game. However I thought that an algorithm that could randomly place the ships on the grid 
at the start of each game was an interesting enough challenge that I decided to still give it a go. Besides, it gave me the opportunity 
to work once again on an AI that could play the game against the player. This process turned out to be way easier than the one I went 
through with Snake, where I had to figure out the AI with a painful trial&error process, but working on it was still a ton of fun and 
I think the end result was satisfying enough.

The code is commented in Italian whenever possible.
