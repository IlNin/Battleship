# Battleship
A fully playable version of Battleship that I made as a passion project while learning Java at University.


<b>Rules:</b><br/>
Try to guess where the enemy ships are positioned on the grid, before your opponent can do the same with you. This game is turn based and doesn't require any skills, just a lot of luck!


<b>Comments:</b><br/>
Well... it's Battleship, hardly an exciting game. However I thought that an algorithm that could randomly place the ships on the grid at the start of each game was a challenge interesting enough that I decided to still give it a go. Besides, it gave me the opportunity to work once again on an AI that could play the game against the player. This process turned out to be way easier than the one I went through with Snake, where I had to figure out the AI with a painful trial&error process, but working on it was still a ton of fun and I think the end result was satisfying enough.<br/>
The code is commented in Italian whenever possible.


<b>Install Instructions:</b><br/>
Compile Main.java with "javac Main.java" and then execute it with "JAVA Main" on your command prompt.<br/>
I've tested this program on Windows systems only: however it should work correctly on other systems if the setSize function of the view windows work exactly as they do on Windows.
